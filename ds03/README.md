# Piscine Data Science â€“ Module 3: Data Scientist 1

This module is part of the 42Bangkok Data Science Piscine and focuses on fundamental machine learning techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning.

Participants will explore model training, evaluation, and clustering, using tools such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Project Overview

- Train supervised machine learning models on labeled data
- Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics
- Apply clustering algorithms to unlabeled datasets
- Use dimensionality reduction to visualize high-dimensional data
- Predict unknown labels (e.g. Jedi or Sith) from feature inputs
